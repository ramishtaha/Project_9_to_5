# Project_9_to_5

This is a project which I started in which I would be doing productive work from 9AM to 5PM everyday on Weekdays(Monday to Saturday). In this timespan I will just be doing productive work focused on my Career.

I have no Idea how I would be doing it and what exactly I would be doing. But I know why I have to do it.
I hope to figure out the things as I progress in my journey, I would be using this Repository to document my Journey.

I am documenting this journey so that I would be reminded about the exact thing on which I should be focused on.
